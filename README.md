# Midnight Forest Chase - Horror game 
### Team Assembly
#


Overview: You play as Alex, a young man on a desperate mission to save his sister Lily from a sinister cult that has taken her hostage in a remote forest. Armed only with a flashlight, Alex must navigate through the dense forest and evade the cultists who are hunting him down. As he searches for Lily, Alex discovers that the cult is not what it seems, and that there is a dark force at work in the forest that threatens to consume them all. Can Alex survive the night and save his sister, or will he meet his doom in the Midnight Forest?

Gameplay: Midnight Forest Chase is a first-person survival horror game that places the player in a terrifying environment where they must constantly evade pursuit by the cultists. Players cannot fight back or interact with most of the environment, but must instead rely on their wits and agility to outrun the cultists and escape with their lives. The game is designed to be a tense and nerve-wracking experience, with plenty of jump scares and eerie sounds that keep the player on edge. The story is revealed through notes and clues that are scattered throughout the forest, adding depth and intrigue to the game's narrative.
As Alex races through the Midnight Forest, he must be careful not to get caught by the cultists or the strange creatures that lurk in the shadows. With a limited supply of stamina, players must carefully manage their movements and make split-second decisions to avoid danger. The game's atmospheric setting, eerie soundtrack, and creepy sound effects add to the horror and tension of the experience.

Can you help Alex find his sister and escape the Midnight Forest before it's too late? The clock is ticking, and the cultists are closing in.
